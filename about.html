                    <p class="about-content">
                        Branding can be broken down into Brand Strategy, Brand Identity and Brand Marketing.<br><br>

                        Branding strategy allows you to map out all aspects of your business's brand to be 
                        able to build a brand identity and then market that to consumers. Aspects such as the 
                        purpose of the business, what is unique, how will customers relate and engage with the 
                        brand, what tone of voice do you want to communicate, where do you want your business 
                        to sit in the market and what are the brand's cultures and values. It is crucial to 
                        consider all of these aspects when building a brand.<br><br>

                        Consumers play an active role in the success of a brand, they are the group 
                        perceiving and engaging with it. It is important to consider the consumers 
                        when building a brand, as essentially, it is for them. They hold a lot of power, 
                        word-of-mouth and reviews about a brand may either positively or negatively affect its success.<br><br>

                        Brand positioning relates to how you set your brand apart from others and 
                        position it in the minds of consumers. Ideally, you want your brand to 
                        stand out as being reliable and valuable, more so than its competitors. Many 
                        strategies can be used to achieve this successfully, such as customer service, 
                        convenience-based, price-based, quality-based, differentiation and social media positioning strategies.
